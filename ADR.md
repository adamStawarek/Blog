# Architectural Decision Logs

This file documents all important architectural decisions, 
along with the justification for each chosen approach. 
Its purpose is to ensure that, in the future, 
I - as the developer of this blog - can understand why a particular solution was selected over 
alternatives and what the consequences of that decision are.

Each record should contain id, title, date, status, context, decision and consequenes.  
Additionaly it should be short and concise.
