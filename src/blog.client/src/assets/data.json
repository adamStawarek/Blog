When I’m not glued to my screen, you’ll find me out running or taking care of my aquarium and its colorful residents. \n\nI started this blog to get better at writing technical documentation. Let’s face it, everyone complains about the lack of it, but no one actually wants to write it ;) For me, it’s also a way to organize my thoughts and really get a grip on the concepts I’m writing about.",
